better-than-xml
===============

A collection of implementations of my personal BTX file format.

In an attempt to at least show the silliness of the XML format, I've decided to implement a near-clone of it that is better in many ways, with the one negative that it won't be 100% human-readable/editable. I plan on creating a simple editor that mitigates that though.

In order to spread awareness, I will implement it in as many programming languages that I know. People who wish to help out are definitely welcome. Any programming languages that are not already represented are encouraged!

More on this later.
